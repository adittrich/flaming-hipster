\section{Introduction}
Since their introduction in the late 1990's P2P Networks have become an
important part of th internet. multiple P2P-based applications like file
sharing, real time audio or video streaming and others make up for an average of
79\% network traffic and 42\% of connections \cite{John+:InetTraffic}. P2P
networks have very large numbers of participants with high fluctuations in
activity. According to \cite{bittorrent} Bittorrent and $\mu$ Torrent, the two
main clients for the Bittorrent file sharing network, had 150 million distinct users in
December 2011. Due to the big size of P2P networks scalability, low diameter and
dynamic membership fluctuations are important issues for network management. In
distributed membership management where there is no central management unit low
cost changes in membership management is the key issue, because of the fast
membership changes.
