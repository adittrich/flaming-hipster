\section*{Abstract}
Peer-to-Peer networks make up a major part of connections and traffic on the
Internet. The big size and the high churn rates in such networks pose a
challenge for the decentralized management of such a network. An interesting
approach to manage membership is, to use gossiping to create random graph like
topologies. Many of those so called peer sampling services have been proposed
and simulated, but they have not yet been examined in realistic network
conditions. This thesis proposes the use of a distributed embedded
sytems testbed environment to examine gossip-based peer sampling service Cyclon
under realistic network conditions. It introduces the statistics gathering web
service and shows how the gathered data can be analyzed. The results are
compared to prior simulations and it is shown that physical network induced
failures have a significant impact on the metrics of the an membership
management overlay topology.
